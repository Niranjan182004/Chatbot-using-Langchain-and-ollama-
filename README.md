# Chatbot-using-Langchain-and-ollama-
This project demonstrates the integration of Langchain with the Llama2 API for a simple question-answering application using Streamlit. The application allows users to input queries through a text input box, which are then processed by the Llama2 model to generate helpful, accurate responses in real time.|
